# Changelog

All notable changes to Agentic Kanban will be documented here.

## [1.6.6] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- `/prompts` command now opens a QuickPick of prompt files for arrow-key selection; copies selected prompt content to clipboard
- `/prompts refresh` preserves the original scaffold/rewrite behavior
- Settings modal Skill Packs tab now shows discovered skills as a checkbox list (replaces free-text input)
- `agentKanban.skillsDirs` setting to specify additional skill directories to scan
- Settings modal (sidebar): Board Config tab (enforcement, WIP limits, worktree policy, transition policies, review-policy matrix) and Skill Packs tab (activeStack, skills, pack cards)
- `labels` serialised last in `board.yaml` for readability

### Changed
- Removed "New Task" button from sidebar
- Verification commands section removed from Settings modal
- Settings modal tab buttons styled with underline indicator

## [1.6.5] - 2026-06-23

- **Restore Branding Assets**: copied and renamed the new three-column logos and icons directly from `.temp/` to their original repository and documentation locations (`images/icon.png`, `images/kanban-icon.svg`, `images/kanban-icon-128x128.svg`, and `docs/src/assets/logo.svg`).
- **Standard Configuration Integration**: removed all custom inline SVG components in favor of Starlight's original configuration layout path.
- **Packaging Exclusions**: updated `.vscodeignore` to exclude the `docs/` workspace and `.temp/` directories, reducing the packaged extension VSIX size from 44 MB to 328 KB.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-06-23

- **Dependency saving fix**: resolved a bug where dependencies added via autocomplete dropdown in the edit/create modal were not saved/persisted because the corresponding `blocked-by:<slug>` label was not synchronized to the Labels list (causing backend saving logic to clear the dependencies).
- **Modal layout alignment**: moved Assignee and Due Date fields to the bottom of the modal, and added a dedicated Dependencies input field supporting task autocompletion and chip management synced bidirectionally with task labels.
- **Workflow documentation**: updated workspace instructions (`assets/INSTRUCTION.md` and `.agentkanban/INSTRUCTION.md`) to explicitly document the `dependsOn` frontmatter array and its bidirectional sync with `blocked-by:<slug>` labels.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-06-23

- **Dependency updates**: merged Dependabot upgrades for TypeScript 6.0.3, Vitest 4.1.9, @types/node 26.0.0, @types/vscode 1.125.0, esbuild 0.28.1, and Tailwind CSS PostCSS 4.3.1
- **Test robustness**: resolved test state contamination by restoring mocks in `afterEach`
- **Compiler configuration**: added explicit node types dependency mapping in `tsconfig.json`

## [1.6.2] - 2026-06-23

- **Parameterized lane sweeps**: `@kanban /sweep [lane]` now supports `--label=`, `--priority=`, and `--pack=`/`--stack=` filtering flags
- **First-class Stack Packs**: dynamic stack pack configurations (`packs.yaml`) for Odoo, Web, Python API, Go, and Frappe automatically seeded on initialize
- **Always-on Project Skills**: Union of project and active pack skills dynamically synced directly into the `AGENTS.md` managed sentinel
- **Dynamic Prompt Interpolation**: prompts under `.agentkanban/prompts/` are now automatically populated with stack-specific coverage requirements and verify commands
- **New `/pack` Command**: command routing for listing packs (`/pack list`) and setting the active pack (`/pack use <name>`)

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-22

- **Dependabot baseline** (`.github/dependabot.yml`): weekly grouped npm + GitHub Actions updates
- **Profile-aware prompt scaffolding**: Lite workspace no longer receives Standard-only stage prompts; `getWorkflowPrompt()`, `buildAgentsMdSection()`, `scaffoldPrompts()` are now profile-aware
- **Resilient board search input**: debounced live search, Enter immediate commit, focus retention across re-renders
- **Workflow doctor diagnostics**: new `@kanban /doctor` command reporting lane drift, stale blockers, dependency cycles, stale worktrees, spec drift, and orphaned deps
- **Structured evidence completion gates**: `TaskEvidence` frontmatter with validator; `review → done` now requires evidence with `ran: true, passed: true`
- **Task lifecycle fields**: `parent`, `superseeds`, `superseededBy`, `blockerResolved` in frontmatter
- **README**: dependency management section added

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-17

- Add a visual dependency graph dialog to the Kanban board, rendering task connections and supporting details navigation.
- Implement configurable transition policies (`requireChecklistForInProgress`, `requireSpecForInProgress`, etc.) in `board.yaml`.
- Integrate automatic verification check execution (test, lint, and build commands) when moving tasks from `in-progress` to `review` on the board.
- Introduce the `@kanban /sweep [lane]` chat command to automatically run verification policies against all ready tasks in a lane, advancing passing tasks and marking failing ones as blocked.
- Enhance board search/filter keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+K to focus, Escape to clear queries).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-17

- Bundle stage-driver prompts: written to `.agentkanban/prompts/` on init (missing files only, so edits survive) and refreshable with `@kanban /prompts`. Includes an autonomous `planning → review` driver plus intake, planning, review, revise, blocked, and production-readiness prompts.
- Add a WIP limit (`wipLimits` in board.yaml; default `in-progress: 1` for the Standard profile). Moving a task into a full lane is blocked (strict) or warned (warn), with the usual human-override path.
- Update the bundled `INSTRUCTION.md`: `in-progress` is not a separate human gate — an approved task can run hands-off to `review`; the human gates are plan approval and `review → done`. Removed a duplicate execution rule.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-16

- Surface spec-driven checklists on the board: the checklist button now opens `<change>/tasks.md` when a task has a `change`, falling back to `todo_<id>.md` otherwise.
- Show a `SPEC` indicator, a `done/total` checklist-progress badge, and a `⚠` badge (missing `change` folder / `spec` file, or a lane outside the active profile) on task cards.
- Treat `change`, `spec`, and `dependsOn` as first-class frontmatter keys (typed, ordered) instead of opaque extras; existing files keep round-tripping.
- Realign `@kanban /spec` to the capability-spec model: it writes one shared `.agentkanban/specs/<capability>/spec.md`, links the task via both `change` and `spec` frontmatter, and no longer scaffolds a nested `changes/<slug>/specs/` delta.
- Refresh the bundled spec templates (proposal / design / spec / tasks) to the behavior-and-acceptance shape; spec is a living contract, not an OpenSpec delta.
- Add `@kanban /archive [slug]` to move a completed change folder to `changes/archive/`, leaving the shared capability spec in place.
- Fold tasks with a lane outside the active profile into the last lane instead of dropping the card.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-06-16

- Prepend a documented reference comment header to serialized `board.yaml` configuration files, detailing profile settings, enforcement rules, and reviewer roles.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-16

- Wire `enforcement` and `reviewPolicy` configurations to make them functional in board lane transitions.
- Add strict vs. warning-based transition validation, returning structured transition blocker reasons.
- Support capture of human override reasons via input boxes, logging them as comments in task files.
- Inject live `enforcement` and priority-aware `reviewPolicy` context into managed `AGENTS.md` instructions.
- Add setting option for default board enforcement mode (`agentKanban.enforcementMode`).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-16

- Expose board profile and worktree configuration options in VS Code settings.
- Seed new `board.yaml` files from user settings.
- Add "Apply Settings to Board Config" command to update existing boards with a modal confirmation safeguard for potential lane conflicts.
- Wire `agentKanban.enforceWorktrees` setting into the `/refresh` workflow as a soft gate.
- Centralize workspace settings resolution and add helper test suites.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-15

- Add opt-in spec-driven development with `@kanban /spec`.
- Scaffold OpenSpec-compatible change artifacts under `.agentkanban/changes/<task-slug>/`.
- Persist task-to-change links through frontmatter as `change: .agentkanban/changes/<task-slug>`.
- Extend AGENTS.md task context so linked spec artifacts are re-read across turns.
- Add bundled spec templates and documentation for the MVP workflow.
- Publish a comprehensive source-available project README and align repository and release metadata.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-15

- Fork release for Agentic Kanban under independent versioning.
- Standard workflow no longer uses a dedicated `blocked` lane. Blockers stay visible on the task card through `blocked` and `blocked-by:<slug>` labels.
- Legacy `lane: blocked` tasks automatically migrate back to `resumeLane` or `backlog` when reopened.
- Task frontmatter keeps unknown metadata such as `dependsOn` across saves, and blocked dependency labels render with warning styling on the board.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-12

- Major change to support Git worktree based workflows, leveraging VS Code support for Git worktrees
- `/plan`, `/todo`, `/implement` `@kanban` participant commands are gone in favour of `/refresh` for non worktree based workflow
- Automatic commit of tasks when creating Git worktrees (for availability in new worktree)
- Documentation updated
